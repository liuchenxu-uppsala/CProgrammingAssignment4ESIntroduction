Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Save Parameters
Save the parameters into a `data.txt` file for later testing.

2. Read Data
Read the data from `data.txt`, split the values by spaces,  
and store them into two arrays: `fst` and `snd`.

3. Sort Data
Call the `quickSort` function twice with `fst` and `snd` as parameters.  
Use bubble sort to sort both arrays individually.  
After sorting, both arrays are arranged in ascending order.

4. Compute Distance
Call the `distance` function.  
Assuming both arrays have the same length,  
iterate through the arrays and sum the absolute differences of the corresponding elements.

5. Get Result
