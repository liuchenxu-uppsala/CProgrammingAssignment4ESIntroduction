Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Save Parameters
Save the parameters into a `data.txt` file for later testing.

2. Read Data
Read the data from `data.txt`, split the values by spaces,  
and store them into two arrays: `fst` and `snd`.

3. Process Each Element of fst
Iterate through the `fst` array, passing each element as a parameter to the function `individualValue`.

4. Compute Individual Value
Inside `individualValue`, iterate through the `snd` array based on the passed parameter.  
Count the number of elements in `snd` that are equal to the passed parameter,  
and return the product of this count and the parameter value.

5. Accumulate Results
Process all elements in `fst` according to step 4,  
and accumulate all the results to obtain the final outcome.
